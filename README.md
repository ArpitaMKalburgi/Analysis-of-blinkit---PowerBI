Blinkit Data Analysis Dashboard

Project Overview
This project features a Power BI dashboard that provides a detailed analysis of Blinkit's sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution. The dashboard helps identify key trends and areas for improvement using various KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) and data visualizations. The goal is to offer valuable insights that can be used to optimize business operations, improve customer experience, and make data-driven decisions.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The dashboard focuses on the following important metrics:
Total Sales: The total revenue generated from all products sold, amounting to $1.20 million.
Average Sales: The average revenue per sale, which is $141.
Number of Items Sold: The total number of different products sold, which is 8,523.
Average Rating: The overall average customer rating for purchased products, which stands at 3.9 out of 5.
These KPIs help in understanding the overall business performance, customer preferences, and sales trends.

Features of the Dashboard
The dashboard includes several key features that help analyze sales and customer trends efficiently:
Filter Panel: This allows users to filter data based on outlet location type, outlet size, and item type, making it easier to focus on specific areas of interest.
Outlet Establishment Trend: A graphical representation of the number of outlets established over time, specifically from 2012 to 2022. This helps in understanding the expansion and growth of Blinkit's outlets.
Fat Content Analysis: This feature breaks down sales into two categoriesâ€”low-fat and regular-fat products. It helps identify consumer preferences based on health-conscious choices.
Item Type Distribution: This visualization categorizes products into different types, showing how sales are distributed across various product categories like groceries, beverages, dairy products, etc.
Outlet Size and Location Analysis: This provides insights into sales performance based on outlet size (small, medium, large) and their location (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3 cities).
Outlet Type Comparison: Compares different types of outlets such as supermarkets and grocery stores, analyzing their sales, number of items, average sales per item, customer ratings, and item visibility.

Insights and Conclusions
Based on the data analysis, the following key insights have been identified:
Strong Sales Performance: Blinkit has generated over $1 million in total sales, indicating a successful business operation.
Customer Preference for Low-Fat Products: The data suggests that health-conscious buying habits are influencing customer choices, with more people opting for low-fat products.
Top-Selling Categories: The best-selling product categories include fruits, vegetables, and snack foods, which are in high demand.
Most Profitable Outlets: Medium-sized outlets in Tier 3 locations generate the highest profits, indicating that smaller cities contribute significantly to sales.
Supermarkets vs. Grocery Stores: Supermarkets generate higher total sales, but grocery stores have better item visibility, meaning customers tend to explore more product options in smaller stores.
